A Little Bit About Me:
I am still fresh in the Software Engineering World but since I started my learning journey in the midst of a pandemic, I know there is no turning back for me. 
My love for music is otherworldly and I enjoy all work that involves a connection to it. 

I'm currently working an Internship that allows me to help those in disadvantaged communities break into tech and I would love to continue aiding those in need with my career. That includes the Black, Indigneous, people of color and LGBTQ+ communities.

Explanation of some bare spots:
Shortly after graduating bootcamp I was offered an internship and that has pushed majority of my git commits to the private sector.

What I'm Currently Reading: Parable of Talents by Octavia Butler
