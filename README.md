ðŸŒ±  A Little Bit About Me ðŸŒ±

I am still fresh in the Software Engineering World but since I started my learning journey in the midst of a pandemic, I know there is no turning back for me. My love for music is otherworldly and I enjoy all work that involves a connection to it. When I'm not coding, you can find me curating new playlists, mixing songs that are stuck in my head, learning 3D modeling, learning a musical instrument(guitar currently) or finding something to change/fix on my car.

ðŸŒ±  Current Work ðŸŒ±
 
After a long hiatus, I am now working independently to build up my skills and head back into the wokforce.

ðŸŒ±  What I'm Currently Reading ðŸŒ±
